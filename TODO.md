Refactor:  highlighted_edge property, Edge.tail_selected property, Node.freeze methods -- these feel a bit messy, can we clean it up?

Highlight edges to show possible moves? Or animate some texture instead?  It feels wrong that the recoloring of these edges is happening in the Node class in any case.
